<h1>What is a telescope</h1> 


   <p>Telescope, device used to form magnified images of distant objects. 
    The telescope is undoubtedly the most important investigative tool in astronomy. 
    It provides a means of collecting and analyzing radiation from 
    celestial objects, even those in the far reaches of the universe.
     
    </p>

    <p> craftsmen and scientists introduced a new tool for studying the heavens. 
        The telescope, one of the central instruments of the Scientific Revolution, soon became the astronomer's most essential tool. 
        Now the astronomer could see countless stars and other faint objects never before visible. Suddenly the universe was no longer limited to what the naked eye could see.
         As telescopes improved, astronomers continued to push back the boundaries of the known universe, peering ever deeper into the surrounding sea of stars known as the Milky Way.</p>

    <h1>Galileo</h1>

    <p>
        Galileo revolutionized astronomy when he applied the telescope to the study of 
    extraterrestrial bodies in the early 17th century.
    Until then, magnification instruments had never been used for this purpose. </p>

    <p>
    Since Galileos
     pioneering work, increasingly more powerful optical telescopes 
    have been developed, as has a wide array of instruments capable of detecting and measuring 
    radiation in every region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Observational capability has been 
    further enhanced by the invention of various kinds of auxiliary instruments
    the camera, spectrograph, and charge-coupled device) and by the use of electronic
      computers, rockets, and spacecraft in conjunction with telescope systems. These developments
       have contributed dramatically to advances in scientific knowledge about the 
       solar system, the Milky Way Galaxy, and the universe as a whole.

<h1>Telescopes of today</h1>
<p>Many scientists believe there's another planet like Earth somewhere in the universe, and the search to find it is about to begin.


    The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be more powerful than its predecessors and will be able to see further into space to discover distant planets in far-off galaxies. 
    It will even give us the tools to search for indications of an atmosphere that could sustain life. It's currently scheduled to launch into space on March 30, 2021.</p>
    <p>
    There are certainly larger Earth-bound telescopes, but as its name implies, the JWST will roam above the atmosphere, providing more powerful unobstructed views
     of the heavens than even the historic Hubble Space Telescope could offer. Funded by NASA in conjunction with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Canadian 
     Space Agency (CSA), the infrared Webb telescope weighs 6 metric tons and will orbit 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. It boasts many new technological advances, 
     including a deployable sunshield and a folding segmented mirror.
    </p>

    <p> 
    "To go to the earliest galaxies, we needed a bigger mirror, and that bigger mirror had to look at a bigger frequency of light," says astrophysicist Blake Bullock, 
    who is a director at Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, the contractor on the project. "It also had to be kept cold — minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit — so it has a sun 
    shield the size of a tennis court that acts as a giant beach umbrella," she adds. "It's like SPF 1 million, blocking the sun's light."</p>
